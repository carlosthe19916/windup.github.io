The Windup team is exited that the reports generated by Windup has been rewriten and it has been aligned to modern standards. The new reports are based on [PatternFly 4](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/) and it uses [ReactJS](https://react.dev/). The old reports were based on [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) and although it served us well for many years, Bootstrap 3 has been moved to its end of life.

This important change gives Windup a modern look and feel making it easy for users to vizualize the data generated after an analysis.

## How to generate the new reports

The new reports are by default enabled and you can continue using Windup as you used to. The new reports are fully integrated with:

- Windup CLI
- Windup Web Console
- Windup Operator

Go to [Downloads](/downloads) and start using Windup.

## Legacy reports

You can continue generating the old reports via `--legacyReports`. E.g.

```shell
$WINDUP_HOME/bin/windup-cli --input myApp.jar --target quarkus --legacyReports
```

The old reports and the new one contain the same data.

## Issues page

- You can visualize `All applications` or _only one application_ issues using the selector `Application` located at the top of the page.
- We added a set of powerful filters to the _issues table_ which will help you have a better visualization of identified issues.
